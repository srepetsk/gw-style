Nine "hardcore terrorists" have been handed death sentences in connection with attacks on military personnel and civilians, Pakistan's army chief announced on Friday.

General Raheel Sharif announced death sentences for nine men convicted of terrorism "including the attack on Parade Lane Mosque, Inter-Services Intelligence Headquarters, Multan, attacks on law enforcement agencies and kidnapping and killing civilians in Lahore," Pakistan's military media outlet Inter-Services Public Relations reported.

The trials of all nine men were conducted in secret by a military court.

The condemned men include Pakistani Taliban member Muhammad Ghauri, who has been linked to a 2009 attack on a mosque used by troops in Rawalpindi, around 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the capital Islamabad. Thirty-eight people died and 57 were injured in the bombing.

Abdul Qayyum, a member of the militant group Harkatul Jihad, was sentenced to death for collaborating in a car bomb attack on the Multan headquarters of Pakistan's secret service, the Inter-Service Intelligence agency.

Two other militants, including a purported al-Qaeda member, are on death row for attacks on soldiers. Five others were sentenced because of their affiliation to the Sipah-e-Sahaba, a Sunni organization linked to the death of five Shiites in Lahore.

Pakistan has executed more than 300 people since lifting a ban on executions in December 2014 after militants killed 124 children at an army-run school in Peshawar.
