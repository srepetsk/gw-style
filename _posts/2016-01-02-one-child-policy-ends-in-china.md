China's one-child policy officially ends today.

Under the new guidelines, announced in October, all Chinese couples can have two children, beginning Jan. 1, 2016.

The one-child policy, enacted in 1980, restricted approximately 37 percent of China's population to one child, with some exceptions, such as for ethnic minorities.

The new policy was created to balance the country's aging population. Guo Zhenwei, a family-planning official with the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said China aims to keep the population at about 1.5 billion.

A traditional preference for boys has led to a serious gender imbalance that China calls the "most serious and prolonged" in the world. Currently there are about 118 boys born for every 100 girls.

China first relaxed the decades-old restriction in 2013 by allowing couples who were themselves only children to have a second child.

As Global Post reports, convincing couples to have a second child may not be easy. The restrictions have "caused deep demographic distortions that have led to economic and social problems that are only expected to worsen in the coming decades," Global Post said.
