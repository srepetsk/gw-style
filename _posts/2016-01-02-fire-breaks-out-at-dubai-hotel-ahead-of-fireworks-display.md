A massive fire broke out at a Dubai hotel ahead of the city's planned New Year's Eve fireworks display on Thursday.

The fire began around 9:30 p.m. at The Address Downtown, a 63-storey high-rise hotel and condominium building near the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. The building contains 196 five-star hotel rooms and 626 serviced apartments.

Gulf News reports that the hotel has been evacuated. Al-Arabiya reported 14 minor injuries and one death due to a heart attack in the rush to escape the area.

New Year's Eve events around the city, including at the Burj Khalifa and the Burj al Arab, went ahead as planned.

On Friday, a spokesperson for the hotel said the fire was contained, although witnesses told Reuters that flames were still visible around the lower floors.

The cause of the fire is not yet known.
