A group of militants staged a pre-dawn attack on an Indian air base near the country's border with Pakistan.

Between four and six people attacked the Panthankot Air Force Base in the state of Punjab, AFP and NDTV reported.

The attack occurred around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday. At least one of the attackers was killed, said Ashwini Kumar, a police official.

NDTV and the hindustantimes reported four attackers and two military personnel were killed.

Members of the Indian National Security Guard were dispatched to the base. Security personnel are currently engaged in fighting with the attackers, the Associated Press reported.
