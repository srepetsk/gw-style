Two people were killed Friday afternoon when a gunman opened fire on patrons in a busy Tel Aviv bar.

At least eight people were injured in the incident, which occurred at the Simta bar on Dizengoff Street in central Tel Aviv.

Police are searching for the assailant, who has not been publicly identified. Israel's Channel 10 News released closed-circuit camera footage from a shop near the bar. The footage shows the suspect, clad in black clothes and dark sunglasses, take a gun out of a backpack before he steps onto the sidewalk and opens fire.

The suspect, who has not been publicly identified, was armed with an assault rifle, Channel 10 reported.

The victims were taken to local hospitals, which confirmed two people died from their injuries.

One of the dead has been named as Alon Bakal, a manager at the Simta, Haaretz reports. The second victim was identified as 30-year-old Shimon Rawimi.

The suspect stole the weapon from his father, who works in security, Haaretz reports. Police said the suspect's father contacted authorities after seeing news footage and learning his weapon was missing.

The suspect has a history of violent behavior, for which his lawyer said he has received mental health treatment.

A massive search is underway for the suspect, who fled on foot, said police spokesperson Luba Samri. One man detained on Gordon Street was later released.

Despite a heavy security presence in the area, Tel Aviv's police commander said there is no need for residents to remain inside.

The motive for the attack is not yet known.
