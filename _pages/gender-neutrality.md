Avoid gendered job titles such as <em>fireman</em>, <em>stewardess</em> or <em>male nurse</em>; use <em>firefighter</em>, <em>flight attendant</em> and <em>nurse</em>.

Use <em>actor</em> to refer to both men and women. The <em>Academy Award for Best Actress</em>, however, is an official category name.

Do not force gender neutrality: Use <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> where appropriate for singular pronouns, not <em>they</em>. Generally, use the pronoun preferred by the subject; if ambiguous, consider writing to avoid pronouns:

<em>The storm battered Robert Smith's home in Cumbria for days. "We were lucky to get out alive," he said.</em>

<em>The storm battered Robin Smith's home in Cumbria for days. "We were lucky to get out alive," Smith said.</em>

Male and female are the proper adjectives to describe a person: <em>female president</em>, not <em>woman president</em>.
