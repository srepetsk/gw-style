A comma (,) before the final conjunction in lists to remove ambiguity: <em>sun, sea, sand, and semaphore</em>

Also called serial commas.

In a complex series, use after each element for clarity: <em>She wore a red blouse with pearl buttons, stockings and black suede shoes, and carried a gold leather handbag.</em>

Do not use a comma before a conjunction in a simple series unless absolutely necessary:
