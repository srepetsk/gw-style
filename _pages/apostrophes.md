An apostrophe (') is used to denote possession, not create plurals.

<em>Jason'sÂ rice</em> is correct; <em>100's of puppies</em> is not.

Add 's to a singular noun: <em>The puppy's rice</em>

Add ' to a plural noun: <em>The puppies' rice</em>

Generally, use 's if a word does not end in s. Apply the same rule for names: <em>The Jones' home.</em>
