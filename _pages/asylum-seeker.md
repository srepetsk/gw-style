An asylum-seeker is a person who claims <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/r/refugee/">refugee</a> status but whose claim has not yet been processed.

The definition is inscribed in international law and is not subject to interpretation. Do not use <em>migrant</em> as a general term for refugee or asylum-seeker.

In times of mass migration, such as the current civil war in Syria, the United Nations refugee agency cannot reasonably process every refugee claim and thus considers people fleeing the situation <em>prima facie</em> refugees until their claims are otherwise refuted. Thus, a person fleeing the war in Syria should be referred to generally as a <em>refugee</em> unless otherwise legally-designated.

Refugee claims are processed by the <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/u/u-n-high-commissioner-for-refugees/">U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees</a>.
