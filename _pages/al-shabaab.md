Islamist group based in Somalia. Singular, not plural.

Fully, <em>Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen</em>, "Movement of Striving Youth"; <em>al-shabaab</em> means "the youth" in Arabic.

Linked to other groups throughout Africa, specifically <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/a/al-qaeda-in-islamic-maghreb/">Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb</a> and <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/b/boko-haram/">Boko Haram</a>; also has links with <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/a/al-qaeda/">al-Qaeda</a>. In October 2015, some members of al-Shabaab pledged allegiance to the <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/islamic-state/">Islamic State</a>; in December, the group ordered those members to leave.
