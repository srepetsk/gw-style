Preferred when referring to the entire land mass and its smaller outlying islands, which is comprised of the countries <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/ireland/">Ireland</a> and <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/n/northern-ireland/">Northern Ireland</a>.

Use Ireland when applying geographic descriptors to the island, eg the west of Ireland, or Ireland's north coast.
