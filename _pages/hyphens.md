Use sparingly.

Use hyphens (-) primarily to avoid ambiguity:

<em>Small business</em> is understood. <em>Small-business owners</em> should be hyphenated to avoid ambiguity.

Compound modifiers that precede a noun take a hyphen: <em>first-quarter goal, full-time job</em>

The hyphen is usually dropped after the noun: <em>goal in the first quarter, works full-time</em>

According to the Associated Press Stylebook, retain the hyphen when a modifier that would be hyphenated before a noun occurs after a form of the verb to be:

<em>Your uncle is well-known. His son is soft-spoken.</em>

Use to avoid repeating vowels or tripling consonants: <em>co-owners</em>,<em> shell-like </em>

Exceptions: <em>cooperate</em>, <em>coordinate</em>
