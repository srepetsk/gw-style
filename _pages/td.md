Teachta Dála: a member of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament).

The official translation is "<em>Deputy to the Dáil"</em>.

Equivalent to <em>Member of Parliament</em> (MP) or <em>Member of Congress</em> used in other states.

&nbsp;

Use: <em>Catherine Murphy TD</em>; the alternative, <em>Deputy Catherine Murphy</em>, could be misinterpreted in other countries.

<em>Irish MP Catherine Murphy</em> is acceptable in headlines but is discouraged.
