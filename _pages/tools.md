Not everything you see and find on the Internet is real - shocking, I know. However, with the use of some tools, the process to narrow down what is real and not can be somewhat straight-forward. Here is a list of some that the community uses.
<ul>
	<li>Translation
<ul>
	<li>Google Chrome: you can right-click a page in a foreign language and press the Translate button. While not 100% accurate, this can give you a good idea of what the content is about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Photo Authenticity
<ul>
	<li>Google Chrome: right-click on the photo, and select the "Search Google for this image" option. You can use this to figure out if and when the photo (or photos similar to what you searched) has been used before which helps determine how old the photo may be. Not all are authentic from when you think they're from.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tineye.com">Tineye</a>: submit a link to a photo online through TinEye, and it will reverse search through everything it's crawled to try and find a match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Video Authenticity
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/citizenevidence/" target="_blank">Youtube DataViewer</a></li>
</ul>
