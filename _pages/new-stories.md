<ol>
	<li>picture</li>
	<li>title (or tag)</li>
	<li>headline</li>
	<li>story</li>
	<li>source(s)</li>
</ol>
At least one source should be included with every article, more if you have them.

&nbsp;

<h3>Picture Credits</h3>
Some of the pics we use come from social media sites.

Add a line to the END of the story like this:
(Image: Agency/Photographer/Where you got it) for example: (Image: AFP/Bob Example/Twitter) or (Image: AP Photo/Person Smith/Facebook)

If there is no agency, leave it out, just give the name of the photographer and where you got it, for example: (Image: Bob Example/Twitter)

It the person sharing the photo uses an obvious fake name, use their handle instead, for example: (Image: @BestExampleGuy/Twitter)

&nbsp;

Note: Use <strong>image</strong> rather than photo or picture to account for all possibilities.

If the image is a Grasswire-created composition of two or more images (for example, a photo overlaid on a map), credit them accordingly (photo, map).
<h5>Images licensed for re-use</h5>
We also use photos licensed for re-use from other sites. Most of these are licensed by Creative Commons.

A good search tool for these images is <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">search.creativecommons.org</a>

These images should be credited in Creative Commons format, and this is where seems to get a bit complicated, but trust me it's not.

We use three of the licenses:
<ul>
	<li>Attribution or <strong>CC BY</strong></li>
	<li>Attribution-ShareAlike or <strong>CC BY-SA</strong></li>
	<li>Attribution-NoDerivs or <strong>CC BY-ND</strong></li>
</ul>
Creative Commons asks that you use the format: Title/Author/Source/License (TASL)

For example: (Image: A Nice Pic/Jim Photographer/Wikimedia/CC BY-SA)

If any of these are not available or unknown it is fine to drop that element.

&nbsp;

Note: The title is a requirement of all CC licenses version 3.0 or earlier and optional for 4.0. The author, source, license and extra notices is required for all CC licenses.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sample-cc-wiki.png" rel="attachment wp-att-721"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-721" src="https://style.srepetsk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sample-cc-wiki-275x300.png" alt="sample-cc-wiki" width="275" height="300" /></a>An example (right):

The author is Michele M. F.

The license element says: "This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license." (CC BY-SA)

There is no obvious name for this pic.

So, the correct attribution is (Photo: Michele M. F./Wikimedia/CC BY-SA)

&nbsp;

See the Creative Commons wiki for more on <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution#This_is_an_ideal_attribution" target="_blank">best practices</a>.

&nbsp;
<h5>Google Images</h5>
Images that are licensed for use which come from Google Images can be difficult to find an author or title for. In this case use whatever information you have in the standard attribution format: (Image: Bob Example/A Website)
<h5>Public Domain</h5>
There is no legal requirement to cite public domain images but you should do it anyway.

&nbsp;

<hr />

<h3>Title or Tag</h3>
The title (or tag) should be brief and specific with an eye to SEO. Note that you cannot reuse titles.

Titles are limited to 30 characters.

Do not type the titles in all-caps; they will generate appropriately on the website. Use general capitalization rules.

<strong>Good</strong>: <em>Oregon refuge</em>, <em>Disneyland Paris arrest</em>, <em>Zika emergency meeting</em>

<strong>Not so good: </strong><em>man arrested at disney</em>, <em>Disney man arrest</em>, <em>disney</em>, <em>Zika virus</em>

<strong>Did you even read this?: </strong><em>GUN ARREST</em>, <em>disneyEURO arrest</em>, <em>ZIKA meeting to be held</em>

<hr />

<h3>Headlines</h3>
Headlines should be concise, specific, useful and timely. The headline should tell the story - more people will read (and engage with) the headline than will ever click on the link.

&nbsp;

Headlines are limited to 76 characters.

&nbsp;

Use verbs and active voice.

&nbsp;

<strong>Good: </strong>Elephant parade tramples local man

<strong>Bad: </strong>Local man killed in elephant migration

&nbsp;

<strong>Good: </strong>Indonesia calls off search for missing ferry passengers

<strong>Bad: </strong>Ferry victim search is called off

&nbsp;

Avoid past exonerative tense: <em>Mistakes were made </em>is a famous example. For more, see McSweeney's <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-ambiguous-grammar" target="_blank">Interactive Guide for Ambiguous Grammar</a>.

&nbsp;

Attribute statements and do not convey fact where there is speculation: <em>Clinton emails may be classified, FBI says</em>

<em>Witnesses: Dozens injured in Mogadishu attack</em>

&nbsp;

Don't rely on numbers to tell the story. <em>3 bombers kill 7 in Jakarta bombings </em>may not be as useful as <em>At least 7 killed in series of Jakarta blasts</em>. Other times, numbers are important to convey scale: <em>Indonesia sanctions 23 companies over peat fires </em>tells the story better than <em>Indonesia sanctions companies over peat fires</em>.

&nbsp;

Superfluous articles and verbs can be omitted and replaced with a comma: <em>Jury acquits Smith on rape, murder charges</em>

&nbsp;

<hr />

<h3>Story</h3>
Good reporting follows the inverted pyramid: The most important information goes at the beginning of the story.

&nbsp;

The first paragraph (the lede) tells the reader who, what, where, when, why and how:

Who is involved?

What happened?

Where did it happen?

When did it happen?

Why did it happen?

How did it happen?

&nbsp;

Be concise.

This paragraph answers the "five Ws and an H" and gives the reader a general idea of what happened while encouraging them to continue reading. Be general in the lede and expound on the details in subsequent paragraphs:

&nbsp;

<em>More than a dozen people people were killed in a series of suicide bombings near Nigeria's capital Abuja on Friday, officials said.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>In the first attack, a pair of bombers detonated suicide vests in a market in the town of Kuje, about 40 kilometers from the capital, killing 13 and injuring 20.</em>

<em>Almost simultaneously, another bomb struck Nyanya, one of Abuja's most populated towns, killing two people and injuring 19 others, according to witness statements.</em>

<em>According to the National Emergency Management Agency, two corpses and one critically injured person were taken to Asokoro General Hospital. The remaining 18 victims are being treated at the Nyanga General Hospital.</em>

&nbsp;

Every statement should be attributed to a source (witnesses, official statements, other reporting). Verify the information. Do not rely on other copy - even wires - to correctly spell a person's name, for example. Links to all sources should be included below the text (See Sources below).

&nbsp;

A note on numbers: Do not get bogged down by the exact number of casualties, for example. In breaking news these numbers change quickly; when there is conflicting or unverified information, use the lower reported number.

&nbsp;
<h3>Sources</h3>
Every statement or fact in the text should have a source (See Story above).

Add a link to every source in the box below the text.

&nbsp;

Note: Associated Press and Reuters website links do not render properly; use a tweet instead. Some sources (The New York Times is one) do not render at all and require you to manually input the information. Either use a tweet or manually input the headline, photo (if available) and lede exactly as they are in the original.
