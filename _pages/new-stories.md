<ol>
	<li>picture</li>
	<li>title (or tag)</li>
	<li>headline</li>
	<li>story</li>
	<li>source(s)</li>
</ol>
At least one source should be included with every article, more if you have them.

<h3>Picture Credits</h3>
Some of the pics we use come from social media sites.

Add a line to the END of the story like this:
(Photo: Agency/Photographer/Where you got it) for example: (Photo: AFP/Bob Example/Twitter) or (Photo: AP Photo/Person Smith/Facebook)

If there is no agency, leave it out, just give the name of the photographer and where you got it, for example: (Photo: Bob Example/Twitter)

It the person sharing the photo uses an obvious fake name, use their handle instead, for example: (Photo: @BobExample/Twitter)

&nbsp;
<h5>Images licensed for re-use</h5>
We also use photos licensed for re-use from other sites. Most of these are licensed by Creative Commons.

A good search tool for these images is <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">search.creativecommons.org</a>

These images should be credited in Creative Commons format, and this is where seems to get a bit complicated, but trust me it's not.

We use three of the licenses:
<ul>
	<li>Attribution or <strong>CC BY</strong></li>
	<li>Attribution-ShareAlike or <strong>CC BY-SA</strong></li>
	<li>Attribution-NoDerivs or <strong>CC BY-ND</strong></li>
</ul>
Creative Commons asks that you use the format: Title/Author/Source/License

For example: (Photo: A Nice Pic/Jim Photographer/Wikimedia/CC BY-SA)

If any of these are not available or unknown it is fine to drop that element.

The author is Michele M. F.

The license element says: "This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license." or CC BY-SA

There is no obvious name for this pic.

So, the correct attribution is (Photo: Michele M. F./Wikimedia/CC BY-SA)

&nbsp;
<h5>Google Images</h5>
Images that are licensed for use which come from Google Images can be difficult to find an author or title for. In this case use whatever information you have in the standard attribution format: (Photo: Bob Example/A Website)
