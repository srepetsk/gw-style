Periods (.) end a declarative sentence: <em>Periods end a declarative sentence.</em>

Use to end a mildly imperative sentence: <em>Use periods to end a declarative sentence.</em>

&nbsp;

Use inside quotation marks: <em>"That's a nice hat." </em>Quotes that are part of a complete sentence take a comma: <em>"Your hat is hideous," he said.</em>

&nbsp;

Use with acronyms that would otherwise spell a word: <em>U.K., U.N., U.S.</em>

Exceptions: <em>EU, AP</em> (a trademark for Associated Press)

Initials of names do not take periods: <em>FBI, FOIA, JFK, MI5, ISIS</em>

Initials in a name do take periods: <em>John F. Kennedy</em>, <em>W.E.B. Du Bois</em>. Note: Du Bois wrote his name with spaces between the letters (<em>W. E. B.</em>); it is written without spaces to avoid appearing on two different lines.

&nbsp;

Use after abbreviated titles: <em>Dr., Ms., Sr., Jr., Lt. Gov.</em>

&nbsp;

Use with time: <em>9 a.m., 7:52 p.m.</em>

&nbsp;
