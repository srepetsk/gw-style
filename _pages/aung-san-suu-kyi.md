Burmese Politician. Sometimes Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The Daw is an honorific and may be dropped.

Names in Myanmar do not contain a surname element. The whole name should be used each time, unless there is a known exception, for example <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/a/aung-san-suu-kyi/">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> may be referred to as Suu Kyi at second reference.
