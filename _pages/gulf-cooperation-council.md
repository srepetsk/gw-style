Spell out on first mention. Can be abbreviated <strong>GCC</strong> on second mention.

&nbsp;

Member states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/u/united-arab-emirates/">United Arab Emirates.</a>

&nbsp;

Do not use interchangeably with "Gulf states": Iraq, a Persian Gulf state, is not a GCC member.
