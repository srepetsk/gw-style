From the Associated Press Stylebook:Â The area of the Americas south of the United States where Romance languages (those derived from Latin like Spanish and Portuguese) are dominant. It applies to most of the region south of the United States except areas with a British heritage: the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and various islands in the West Indies. Suriname, the former Dutch Guiana, is an additional exception.
