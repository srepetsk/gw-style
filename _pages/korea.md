<strong>North Korea</strong>, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and <strong>South Korea</strong>, officially the Republic of Korea, are divided by the <strong>Demilitarized Zone</strong>.

&nbsp;

<em>North</em>, <em>South</em> and <em>DMZ</em> are acceptable on subsequent mentions.

&nbsp;

The Koreas are technically still in a state of war; an armistice signed on July 27, 1953 created the DMZ but no peace treaty was ever signed.
