<strong>North Korea</strong>, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and <strong>South Korea</strong>, officially the Republic of Korea, are divided by the <strong>Demilitarized Zone</strong>.

&nbsp;

<em>North</em>, <em>South</em> and <em>DMZ</em> are acceptable on subsequent mentions.

&nbsp;

The Koreas are technically still in a state of war; an armistice signed on July 27, 1953 created the DMZ but no peace treaty was ever signed.

&nbsp;
<h3>North Korea</h3>
<strong>Pyongyang</strong> is the capital.

Leader: <strong>Kim Jong-un</strong>. He is not the president:Â His grandfather Kim Il-sung holds the title President for eternity; his father Kim Jong-il holds the title Supreme Leader for eternity.

Kim Jong-un has chosen his own titles:
<ul>
	<li>Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army</li>
	<li>Marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Il-sung and Jong-il hold the titles great marshal)</li>
	<li>First Chairman of the National Defense Commission</li>
	<li>First Secretary of the Workers' Party</li>
	<li>Chairman of the Workers' Party Central Military Commission</li>
</ul>
It is sufficient to refer to Jong-un as the leader or supreme leader.
<h3>South Korea</h3>
President: Park Guen-hye

Prime Minister: Hwang Kyo-ahn

The capital is <strong>Seoul</strong>.

&nbsp;
<h3>Korean Names</h3>
Written in two parts with a hyphen: <em>Kim Jong-un</em>, <em>Park Guen-hye</em>; they become <em>Kim</em> and <em>Park</em> on second mention.
