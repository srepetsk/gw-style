See <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/islamic-state/">Islamic State</a>

Daesh is play on words: <em>Da’esh</em> is an acronym for the Arabic <i>al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī al-ʻIrāq wa-al-Shām (Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham)</i>, used because it is similar to the verb <i>daes</i>, which means to crush something underfoot, or <i>dāhis</i>, one who sows discord.

Daesh has been adopted by some western politicians in an attempt to undermine the group’s credibility.

Use <em>Islamic State</em>.
