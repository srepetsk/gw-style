The official short form of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

For political reasons <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/u/u-k/">U.K.</a> is preferred, although British may also be used as an adjective e.g. the British government.

Great Britain, however, refers to England, Wales and Scotland collectively.
