On first reference, <strong>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</strong>.

<strong>LDS</strong> is acceptable on subsequent mentions.

&nbsp;

<strong>Latter-day Saints</strong> is the preferred term for LDS members, although <strong>Mormon </strong>is acceptable and may be more recognized.

&nbsp;

The Church's <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/style-guide" target="_blank">in-house style guide</a> advises against <em>the Mormon Church</em>, <em>the LDS Church</em> and <em>Church of Latter-day Saints</em>.

&nbsp;

Houses of worship are temples: <em>The LDS Temple in Philadelphia is undergoing renovations.</em>

&nbsp;

The Church says:
<ul>
	<li>"Mormon" is correctly used in proper names such as the Book of Mormon, Mormon Tabernacle Choir or Mormon Trail, or when used as an adjective in such expressions as "Mormon pioneers."</li>
	<li>The term "Mormonism" is acceptable in describing the combination of doctrine, culture and lifestyle unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</li>
	<li>When referring to people or organizations that practice polygamy, the terms "Mormons," "Mormon fundamentalist," "Mormon dissidents," etc. are incorrect. The Associated Press Stylebook notes: "The term <i>Mormon</i> is not properly applied to the other … churches that resulted from the split after [Joseph] Smith's death."</li>
</ul>
