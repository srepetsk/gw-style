A militant organization that controlled parts of Iraq and Syria after 2014.

Use <em>Islamic State group</em> or similar on first mention. Can be abbreviated to <em>IS</em>.

Lead by <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/b/al-baghdadi-abu-bakr/">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>.

Referred to variously as Daesh, ISIL and ISIS.

Formerly <em>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</em> (ISIL), alternately translated as <em>Islamic State of Iraq</em> <em>and Syria</em> or <em>Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham</em> (ISIS). After June 2014, refers to itself as <em>Islamic State</em>.

Daesh is play on words: <em>Da'esh</em> is an acronym for the Arabic <i>al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī al-ʻIrāq wa-al-Shām (Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham)</i>, used because it is similar to the verb <i>daes</i>, which means to crush something underfoot, or <i>dāhis</i>, one who sows discord.

Daesh has been adopted by some western politicians in an attempt to undermine the group's credibility.

Do not use<em> the Islamic State</em> to refer to land occupied by IS. Avoid using <em>Daesh</em> and terms such as <em>self-styled</em> or <em>so-called</em> except in quotes; these carry political implications outside the scope of news reporting.
