According to the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/office-of-partner-engagement/active-shooter-incidents" target="_blank">FBI</a>, an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people with a firearm.

An individual with a weapon is not an active shooter if they have not pulled the trigger.
<p class="p1">Until a shot or shots have been fired, think suspect, man with a gun, woman who may have a gun.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/september/fbi-releases-study-on-active-shooter-incidents/pdfs/a-study-of-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-u.s.-between-2000-and-2013" target="_blank">designation</a> exists to alert law enforcement to "an aspect of the crime [that] may affect the protocols used in responding to and reacting at the scene of the incident."</p>
