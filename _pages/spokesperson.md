The Associated Press Stylebook recommends <em>spokesman</em> and <em>spokeswoman</em>. It's 2016: Use <em>spokesperson</em>.

Better: Use a neutral word such as <em>representative</em>Â or the person's title or role that provides more information: <em>Sgt. Jeannie Hadley, public information officer for the department</em>
