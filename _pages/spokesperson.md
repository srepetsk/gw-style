The Associated Press Stylebook recently added <em>spokesperson </em>to the book, to be used instead of <em>spokesman</em> and <em>spokeswoman </em>when preferred by the individual or organization.

It's 2016: Use <em>spokesperson</em>.

Better: Use a neutral word such as <em>representative</em> or the person's title or role that provides more information: <em>Sgt. Jeannie Hadley, public information officer for the department</em>
