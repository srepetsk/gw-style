A person who dresses in a style or manner traditionally associated with the opposite sex. Their gender does not change. A man who dresses as a woman is still a man. Do not confuse with transgender.

A <strong>drag queen</strong> is a person, usually male, who dresses and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles. Often they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all sexualities.
