A person who dresses in a style or manner traditionally associated with the opposite sex. Their gender does not change. A man who dresses as a woman is still a man. Do not confuse with transgender.

&nbsp;

A <strong>drag queen</strong> is a person, usually male, who dresses and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all sexualities.
