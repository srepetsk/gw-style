A country in southeast Asia, also known as Burma. For political reasons Myanmar is preferred.

People from Mayanmar are Burmese.

Names in Myanmar do not contain a surname element. The whole name should be used each time, unless there is a known exception, for exampleÂ <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/a/aung-san-suu-kyi/">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> may be referred to as Suu Kyi at second reference.

U or Daw in a name is an honorific and may be dropped.
