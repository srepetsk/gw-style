A geographical term meaning <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/b/britain/">Great Britain</a>, <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/island-of-ireland/">Ireland</a> and some or all of the adjacent islands such as Orkney, Shetland and the Isle of Man. The phrase is best avoided, given its unpopularity in Ireland.

Alternatives adopted by some publications are British and Irish Isles or simply Britain and Ireland.
