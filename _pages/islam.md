Followers are called <strong>Muslims</strong>; Muslim is not a religion.

&nbsp;

Adjective is <strong>Islamic</strong>. Muslim is not an adjective.

&nbsp;

An <strong>Islamist</strong> is an adherent of <strong>Islamism</strong>, or political Islam. Islamists view the Quran as both a political and religious code. Islamist can carry political implications; use with discretion.

&nbsp;

Holy book is the <strong>Quran</strong>, not Qur'an or Koran.

&nbsp;

More than 1.6 billion people are followers of Islam.

&nbsp;

Major sects are <strong>Sunni</strong> and <strong>Shia</strong>.

&nbsp;
<h3>Sunni</h3>
Sunni is a noun or adjective; the plural of Sunni (n.) is <em>Sunnis</em>.

&nbsp;

The majority (85 to 90 percent) of Muslims are Sunni. Sunni Muslims include followers of the Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki and Hanbali schools of jurisprudence and the Salafi movement.

&nbsp;

Sunnis are the majority in more than 40 countries, including Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
<h3>Shia</h3>
<strong>Shia</strong> ("follower") describes the collective; an individual is a <strong>Shiite</strong>:<em> </em><em>They are Shia. He is a Shiite.</em>

Shias include Ithna Asharis (Twelvers), Ismailis, Zaydis, Alevis and Alawites.

&nbsp;

The Pew Research Group estimates there are between 154 million and 200 million Shias in the world today.

&nbsp;

Between 35 and 40 percent of the world's Shias (66 to 70 million) live in Iran. Shias make up a majority of the total population in Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Iraq; between 68 and 80 percent of the world Shia population live in Iran, Pakistan, India and Iraq, all of which have at least 16 million Shias.

&nbsp;

There is a sizable Shia population (1 million or more) in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey and Yemen.

&nbsp;
<h3>Other Sects</h3>
The <strong>Baha'i </strong>in Iran; <strong>Kharijites</strong>, found in Oman; the <strong>Nation of Islam</strong> in the United States; and the <strong>Druze</strong>, found primarily in Lebanon but also in Syria and Israel, are Muslims who cannot be easily classified as either Sunni or Shia.

<strong>Sufism</strong> has followers among both Shias and Sunnis as well as adherents who identify primarily as <em>Sufi</em>.
