Generally, a person who moves from one place to another.

For political reasons, some government representatives, commentators and news media use migrant to refer to <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/a/asylum-seeker/">asylum-seekers</a> and <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/r/refugee/">refugees</a>. Avoid this.

Migrant should be used to refer to people who emigrate primarily for economic reasons or to refer generally to emigrants.
