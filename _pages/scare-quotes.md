Quotes ("") placed around a word or phrase to indicate it is being used ironically or in a nonstandard way:

<em>The so-called "bedroom tax"</em>

<em>The so-called "Islamic State"</em>

<em>"Activists" were upset</em>

Scare quotes have no place in journalism; save them for fighting on the Internet.
