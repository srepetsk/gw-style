A country that covers most of the <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/island-of-ireland/">island of Ireland</a> and includes some smaller outlying islands.

Do not use Éire or Southern Ireland.

Also known as the Republic of Ireland, although this should only be used for clarification when referring to both it and <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/n/northern-ireland/">Northern Ireland</a>, or to the national <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/f/football/">football</a> team.

Also, a generalised term for the island of Ireland. Use when applying geographic descriptors, eg the west of Ireland, or Ireland's south coast.
