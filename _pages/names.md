Generally, use the name a person chooses to be identified by: <em>Chelsea Manning, Caitlyn Jenner, Madonna, Muhammad Ali</em>

Identification of prominent figures should consider an international audience:

<em>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry</em>

<em>U.K. Chancellor George Osborne</em>

<em>Barack Obama said (first mention) ... the president recalled (second mention)</em>
