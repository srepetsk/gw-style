Use a colon (:) at the end of a sentence to begin a list or text (this example is meta):

<em>The war plane was painted three colors: red, white and blue</em>

Capitalize the first letter of the word following a colon if it is a proper noun or begins a complete sentence:

<em>She sent a message to her niece: Nancy, she said, there is a tsunami alert.</em>

<em>The implication was clear: They had to get to higher ground before the wave reached the coast.</em>

But: <em>They had two objectives: divide and conquer.</em>

Use to introduce a long quote within a paragraph. Colons belong outside of quotation marks unless they are part of the quote.

Use colons for time of day (<em>1:30</em> <em>p.m.</em>,<em> 12:45 a.m.</em>), time elapsed (<em>01:23:45</em>) and legal citations (U.S. Code 5:552).
