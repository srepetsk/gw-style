A province in the north of the <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/i/island-of-ireland/">island of Ireland</a>.

Sometimes used to refer to the country <a href="https://style.srepetsk.net/n/northern-ireland/">Northern Ireland</a>, although this is incorrect: three of the counties that make up Ulster lie outside Northern Ireland.
